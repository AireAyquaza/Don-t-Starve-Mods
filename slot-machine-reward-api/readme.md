**Slot Machine Reward API**
===================


Introduction
---------------------
This mod is an API, it allows you to add custom reward for the slot machine in Don't Starve Shipwrecked. Default files for slot machine not allow that. This is the reason I make this API.

How to use this API
----------
To use this API an create your own reward for slot machine, i'd make a [template mod](https://github.com/AireAyquaza/Don-t-Starve-Mods/tree/master/template-for-making-mod-with-slot-machine-reward-api) you can modify.

All files in this API are commented. You should see them to write your own mod.

Any mods witch are written with this API need this API to be enabled as a mod into the game
